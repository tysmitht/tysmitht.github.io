                This is a variation on standard clock arrangements with the hour hand, minute hand, and occasionally the second hand. One thing I struggled with on this project
                is how the Python module PyGame handles drawing the arcs. The default often had many pixels missing. I put a lot of effort into finding a better solution before
                settling on drawing the same arcs multiple times shifted by a pixel. It is still not perfect but it is much better than the original.
