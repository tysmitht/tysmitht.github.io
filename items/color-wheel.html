                A simple color wheel. It works well for computers
                to work in an red-green-blue (RGB) color space but
                for humans, I find it is easier to work in the 
                hue-saturation-value (HSV) color space. The rotation
                around the wheel is the hue or color. Then with that,
                it is much clearer why certain colors coordinate
                better.
