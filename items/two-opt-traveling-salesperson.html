            This is a demonstration of the 2-Opt Traveling
            Salesperson Algorithm. This algorithm generates
            an approximate solution. This problem is 
            NP-Complete so an algorithm that generates 
            the perfect solution is not currently known, if
            it even exists.
        </p>
        <p>
            The heart of this algorithm is to iteratively 
            reverse sub-paths that shorten the length of
            the overall path. At each step, it tries each 
            possible reversal and commits the best update.
            Steps continue until there does not exist a 
            reversal that would shorten the path.
