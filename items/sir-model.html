                For modeling disease spread, the SIR model is
                a purposefully simple model. Let $S$ (blue) be the percentage 
                of people currently susceptible to a virus. Let $I$ (red)
                be the percentage infected and let $R$ (green) be the percentage
                that has recovered (or died). $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are
                constants indicating the transmission and recovery rates
                of the disease. $I$ is initially small. This assumes that
                once someone recovers, they are permanently immune.

                This model uses a set of differential equations to
                model the spread of this disease, namely
                $$
                \begin{align*}
                S' &= -\alpha SI \\
                I' &= \alpha SI - \beta I \\
                R' &= \beta I \\
                \end{align*}
                $$
            </p>

                I solved this with, what I now know, is Euler's method.
                If I did this again, I would use a better, more
                acurate method, like Runge-Kutta.
