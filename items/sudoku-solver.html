                Just a classic sudoku solver. There are
                many different logical rules that can be
                used to attempt a solve but there are
                always sudokues that cannot be solved
                with any set of logical rules. 
                Backtracking, as shown here, is
                guaranteed to reach a solution.

                The algorithm actually completes a solve
                in a fraction of a second, but drawing it
                is what takes the most time.
