                I was working a project with someone else and we
                wanted to create a smooth gradient from red to 
                yellow to green. I put this together in about
                20 minutes to demosntrate why linear Interpolation
                of colors needs to be done in the HSV color space.
                If restricted to the RGB color space, the code would
                become very messy and overly complicated.
