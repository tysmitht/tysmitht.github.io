                The Traveling Salesperson is a well known problem
                in comptuer science. Algorithms for finding optimal
                solutions are generally very slow. However, there
                are many relatively fast solutions for finding
                approximate solutions.

                This is an implementation of the 2-opt algoithm.
                At each step, it looks at each pair of points then
                creates a trial path that is the same as the current
                best path but the segment between the pair of points
                is reversed. If the trial path is better, record it.
