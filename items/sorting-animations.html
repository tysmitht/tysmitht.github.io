                You see audio based visualisations of
                sorting algorithms online frequently. 
                This is a color based visualisation.
            </p>
            <p>
                Each visualisation starts with a sorted
                list which is then shuffled using 
                Fisher-Yates then the chosen sorting occurs.

                My favorite algorithm is merge sort but I 
                think odd-even or comb are the most interesting
                visually.
