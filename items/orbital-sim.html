                Satellites have to be moving at an incredible
                velcoity perpendicular to the earth. If a
                satelltie was not going fast enough, it'd 
                fall to the earth. This demonstration models
                what happens to satellites going different speeds
                around the earth, ranging from initally stationary
                to just the right amount of speed to maintain a
                circular orbit.
