                This is based on a fun dice game. Each player
                has two scores, initially set to zero. Let's
                call them the current score and banked score. 
                On their turn, they roll a single die as many 
                times as they want, each time adding the 
                rolled value to their current score. Instead
                of rolling, they may bank their points in which
                case their current score is added to their banked 
                score and their turn ends. However, if they roll
                a one, their turn ends without adding to their
                banked score.

                What is a good strategy? One strategy is the
                player continue to roll until they reach some
                pre-defined goal. If they reach it (or exceed it),
                they end their turn. If not, roll again.

                If your goal is too low, you will not earn enough
                points in a turn. If your goal is too high, it is
                unlikely you will earn any points in a turn. You 
                could do some analysis to determine the optimal score
                or you could simulate it like I did. The blue bars are
                the current evaluation. The orange dots are the true 
                values.
