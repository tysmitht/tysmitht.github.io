                Which planet is closest to the Earth? This seems
                like a simple question but as can be seen, its
                not so cut and dry. Depending on where each planet
                is in it's orbit, one planet might be closest or
                another.

                Here's a better question. Which planet is closest
                to the Earth most of the time? You might think its
                Mars or perhaps Venus but, strangely, the 
                answer is Mercury
            </p>
            <p>
                Even more strangely, Mercury is the closest object,
                on average, to everything that orbits around the Sun
