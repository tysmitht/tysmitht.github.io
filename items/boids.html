                Boids is an algorithm that simulates the flocking
                behavior of bids. By using a few simple rules for 
                each boid to follow, flocking behavior emerges.

                One of the rules is alignment, which tries to steer
                toward the average heading of nearby boids. Another 
                is separation which tries to steer away from other boids
                that are too close. The last key rule is cohesion which is
                to try to move to the average position of nearby boids.
