                The goal here is to make a machine learning model that can decide what color text, black or white, looks best on a random colored background.
            <p>
                When I really first started programming, I was really into the idea of machine learning. It was and still is incredibly fascinating to me. However, 
                there was a key issue when I made this project. I didn't know how to do machine learning. I knew the term neural network and that it was several layers
                of nodes. That was it.

                I put time into figuring out how to make my own naive nerual network which, admittedly, I couldn't get to work properly at the time. Now that I have
                a decent understanding of machine learning, it seems like the model I made then is just underfitting. I can confirm this because when I look
                at the code, it looks like the model is not being trained properly. It seems like I only gave it one epoch with each training sample. Woops!
            </p>

                I know I could go back and redo this project in a few hours so that might be fun to do one day.
