                Given a graph, there are many different ways to find a path between two nodes. A couple of naive search algorithms would be breadth-first or depth-first.
                A* is most accuractely described as a best-first search.

                At each iteration, the choice of which node to explore is the node, n,  which minimizes $f(n)=g(n)+h(n)$
                where $g(n)$ is the true cost from the starting node to $n$ and $h(n)$ is a hueristic function estimating the cost from n to the ending node.
                In this demonstration, $h(n)$ could just be the straight-line distance.
