            Pathfinding algorithms are designed to find 
            the shortest path from a start node to an 
            end node in a given graph. The applications 
            of pathfinding can be quite widespread. 
            While I can't say confidently this is how 
            it is done, pathfinding algorithms like A* 
            could be used to determine the optimal 
            routing of data packets on the internet.

            A more naive pathfinding algorithm might 
            be a breadth-first or depth-first search. 
            A* would be considered an informed search 
            method or best-first search.

            At each iteration of the main loop, to determine which potential path to extend, A* selects the path that minimizes
