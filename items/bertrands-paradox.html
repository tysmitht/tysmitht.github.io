                This is a demonstration of Bertrand's Paradox.
                Let $c$ be a random chord through a circle with length $\ell$. 
                Inscribe an equilateral triangle in that circle and denote 
                its side length as $s$. What then is $P(\ell > s)$?
            </p>

                By looking at a few different (but perfectly reasonable) 
                methods for selecting $c$, we can get different probabilities.
                The point Bertrand is trying to make is that even if there is
                no bias in your method, you aren't guaranteed a well-defined
                result.
