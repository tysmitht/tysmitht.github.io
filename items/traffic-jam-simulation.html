                If you've ever been driving on the highway in traffic
                then, all of the sudden, it clears up, this is a
                simulation showcasing why that happened.
            </p>
            <p>
                If drivers only focus on the car in front of them to
                avoid a collision, then the tiniest decrease in one
                speed causes the car behind them to brake to a little
                slower, then repeat for the next car and the next and
                so on. This happens until eventually one car stops
                completely.
            </p>
            <p>
                A way to prevent this is to not only look at the car
                in front of you but also behind you and try to move to
                the halfway point.
