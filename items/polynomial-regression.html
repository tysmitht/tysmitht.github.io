                This was the first project I did when I was
                originally learning how to use PyGame.
                Given any series of points, which quartic
                polynomial is the best fit.

                Back then I had to use a Numpy function to
                do the regression but I have recently learned
                in MTH451 (Numerical Analysis) how to do 
                polynomial regressions myself so now I could
                implement this myself.
