                Bezier curves are most commonly used in computer graphics To
                generate smooth, arbitrary curves. They are great for computers
                because a single bezier curve can be described by less than 10 
                integers.

                Typically, you see Bezier curves represented by a system of equations
                which is better for computation and actually using a Bezier curve in 
                the real world. However, this method was my first introduction to 
                Bezier curves.
