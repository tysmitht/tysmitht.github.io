                I wanted to make myself an animated desktop
                wallpaper so I went with lava lamps. According
                to my research, the best way to draw the orbs
                in a lava lamp is by using the iso-surface
                algorithm.
            </p>
            <p>
                The complication is the iso-surface algorithm
                is, computationally, very expensive. For every
                frame of animation, you have to loop over each
                pixel and for each pixel you have to loop over
                each iso-ball and do an expensive set of operations.
            </p>
            <p>
                The naive implementation ran at around 0.1 frames
                per second (FPS). Most of my work on this project
                was about speeding it up where it was eventually 
                capable of running at around 150 FPS, a 1500x speedup.
