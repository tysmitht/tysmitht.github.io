                The wave function collapse algorithm can be applied to a
                wide variety of applications. It can be used to solve
                <em>Sudoku</em> or <em>Minesweeper</em> but a common
                application is procedural graphics generation. My implementation 
                uses the algorithm to generate images of circuit boards that 
                look like the demo, completely randomly.
            </p>
            <p>
                The idea behind the algorithm is, initially, each of the tile
                slots can be any of the possible tiles so each slot is a
                superposition of tiles. To start, one tile is randomly chosen,
                then that tile is 'collapsed' wherein it's tile is chosen from
                each of its possible options.
            </p>
            <p>
                When that tile is placed, it limits the options of nearby tiles,
                which reduces the entropy of those tiles. At each step, a slot
                with the minimum entropy is chosen and it is collapsed in
                the same fashion. Some backtracking is needed in case an impossible
                situation is reached.
